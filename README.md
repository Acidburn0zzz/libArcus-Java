libArcus-Java
=============

libArcus is a lightweight, easy to use library to send and receive messages between two programs based on the Protocol Buffers library by Google. It was originally developed by Ultimaker and is primairly used to communicate with their CuraEngine. This is a port of the original library to the programming language Java. The API is almost identical to make working with both libraries more easy.

Usage
-----
```java
// Create a new instance
ArcusSocket socket = new ArcusSocket();

// Add a listener
socket.addListener(...);

// Register a message type
socket.registerMessageType(MyType.getDefaultInstanceForType());

// Start listening on the specified port
socket.listen(...);

// Send a messages
socket.sendMessage(...);

// Retrieve a received message
Message message = socket.takeNextMessage();

// Check of message type
if (message != null && message instanceof MyType) {
    doStuff((MyType) message);
}

// Close the connection
socket.close();
```
